# CS373_2023_Assignment_Barcode_Detection

The assignment looked at using image processing techniques to isolate the bar code and then create a bounding box around it. This was achieved through multiple iterations of filtering, erosion and dilation. Followed by grouping pixels into objects so the box could be drawn. Note all the importing of images and the display were provided in the skeleton code .

My final product performed well on the examples provided to us by the lecturer but struggled on photos i took myself. This is likely because I over tuned part of the algorithm to do well on the provided examples and not unseen examples.
